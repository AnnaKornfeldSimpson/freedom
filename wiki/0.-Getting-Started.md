*freedom.js* lets you build powerful portable web app backends without worrying about the complex distributed systems problems in a typical web framework. You can write your entire application using core client-side technologies you're already familiar with: HTML, JavaScript, and MVC frameworks. Ship the code using a static web server and we'll do the rest! This tutorial will walk through writing a collaborative document editor.

The source code for this tutorial can be found here:

### Declare your Backend Module
The very first thing we'll need to write is a *[manifest file](/UWNetworksLab/freedom/wiki/Manifest-Files)*, which we will name [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/freedom/blob/master/demo/texteditor/00/manifest.json). The manifest file is just a JSON-formatted table that describes the backend module's name, description, version number, etc. At a high-level, it tells *freedom.js* where the code for the module is and what permissions it requires.

    {
      "name": "Text Editor",
      "description": "Simple collaborative text editor"
      "app": {
        "script": "main.js"
      }
    }

Most of the file is self-explanatory. The "app" attribute points to the script that contains the code for the backend module. Note that this path is relative to the manifest file. 

### Start writing your backend module
For the time being, the [`main.js`](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/freedom/blob/master/demo/texteditor/00/main.js) script simply prints out "Hello World" when the module is loaded. 

    console.log('Hello World!');

### Write your page
Now we have to write our main page, [`index.html`](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/freedom/blob/master/demo/texteditor/00/index.html). This outer page instantiates *freedom.js* and all of the backend modules in the application (currently there is only one). We can instantiate *freedom.js* by including the script and pointing the *data-manifest* attribute to our *manifest file*. 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang='en-US'>
    <head>
    <script type='text/javascript'
        src='/freedom.js'
        data-manifest='manifest.json'>
      {
        "strongIsolation": true,
        "debug": true,
        "stayLocal": true
      }
    </script>
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...

In the text content of the script tag, we can specify a JSON object of options. Currently there are 3: **strongIsolation** should be true for all production-ready code. During development, it can help to occasionally turn this off for better error messages. **debug** prints internal *freedom.js* log messages to console. **stayLocal** is a highly experimental feature, which we currently recommend to stay true.

Remember to point the script tag to the proper paths! The paths above reflect the configuration when a web server is serving from the base directory of the [`freedom.js`](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/freedom) repository.

You can also find a compiled version of the library [here] (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~wrs/freedom.js) or [compile it] (/UWNetworksLab/freedom/wiki/Compiling-FreeDOM) yourself from this repository. 

### Run it!
The easiest way to run the demo is by cloning the [`freedom.js`](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/freedom) repository. From the base directory, run (python is a dependency):

    LOCAL=yes make demo

Then navigate to **http://localhost:8000/demo/texteditor/00** on your browser. This will compile *freedom.js* and start a local web server using 'python -mSimpleHTTPServer'. If you want to do this yourself, remember to point your `index.html` script tags to the right place.
